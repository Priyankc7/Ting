# ActionMenu

```js static
import ActionMenu from "@dgn-src-ui/core/ActionMenu";
```

## Usage

`ActionMenu` is an opinionated and custom styled select menu. It is usually a link with a caret symbol that displays options when opened.

The children of `ActionMenu` can be anything. Internally each child is placed within a `MenuItem` component. The style and spacing of the menu option is dependent on whatever you passed in as a child. It assumes no styling other than the menu itself.

If you set an `onClick` handler for the `ActionMenu`, you can use the `value` prop on any of the children to set a value that will be passed to the click handler when the menu item is clicked on.

```jsx
<ActionMenu onClick={val => console.log(val)}>
  <Link href="#" value="activate">
    Activate
  </Link>
  <Link href="#" value="deactivate">
    Deactivate
  </Link>
  <Link href="#" value="combust">
    Combust
  </Link>
</ActionMenu>
```

## Props
