<Meta title="View" component={View} />;

# View

```jsx
import View from "@dgn-src-ui/core/View";
```

```jsx
```

## Usage

View is a screen loading component for all of the available UI screens. It wraps each screen in the `AppLayout` component and sets up context for a global configuration object and theming.

```jsx
import View from "@dgn-src-ui/core/View";

// ...

const EnterShippingAddress = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);
  const operationThatTakesTime = () => {
    // Takes time
    setLoading(false);
  };

  <View
    screen="ShippingAddress"
    form={{
      onSubmit: (data, e, context) => {},
      defaultValues: {
        addressId: 5,
        name: "Montgomery Smith",
        line1: "123 NW 45th ST",
        city: "New York",
        state: "NY",
        zip: "10001",
        countryCode: "US",
      },
    }}
    loading={loading}
  />;
};
```

Any additional properties beyond the ones listed below will be passed along to the UI screen component.

## Props

<Props of={View} />

## Notes

- The actual loading is done by a separate component called `ViewLoader`. See component code for details.
- Needs more robust error handling for passing in screen strings (import errors, etc)
