# Get Started

=== Technologies ===

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) - React
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node package manager
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) - Material-UI
- [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Storybook

## Installation

Since this project is being delivered as "copy" files, installation may not be necessary. If you wish to actively see the screens or run Storybook locally, simply install the project with npm.

```
npm install
```

### Running the project or Storybook locally

If you wish to run the project or view Storybook locally, the following commands are available to you:

`npm run start`
Starts the application in development mode and runs on a local port. If you have pre-built storybook, a static version of storybook will be available at `/storybook`.

`npm run storybook`
This runs the application on a different port in development mode and launches Storybook. This will not make it available at `/storybook` with the main application running.

`npm run build-storybook`
This command will build a static version of Storybook and will place the files in the `./public` directory. If the project is then run or built, the static version of Storybook will be available at `/storybook`.

`npm run build`
This will build out a static version of the entire app into a `/build` folder. The contents of the `public` folder are treated as static files and also copied over to the `build` folder. `npm run build-storybook` must be run prior to this if the final build needs to include the static Storybook app.

## Staging Site

A static version of the site is available on MCD servers. This site will always contain the most recently delivered version of the site.

It is password protected. If you believe you should have access to it, contact your project manager either they or the MCD development team can give it to you.

**Site:** [https://dgn-checkout.mcdpartners.dev/](https://dgn-checkout.mcdpartners.dev/)
**Storybook:** [https://dgn-checkout.mcdpartners.dev/storybook/](https://dgn-checkout.mcdpartners.dev/storybook/)

## Integration

This repository is meant to hold a working version of the UI for the SRC project. It does not contain any backend logic or connections. The goal of these UI screens are to negate the need to modify them post-delivery. Because this is an iterative project, making changes to the UI files will pull them out of sync with the files being continually delivered by the MCD team. If this happens, you will have to maintain changes and continually update your versions when new code is delivered.

General documentation (like this README) will eventually move into Storybook along with the documentation on all of the components and screens. Until then, this README contains the general information you need for integrating and Storybook contains all of the documentation for components and screens. The documentation in Storybook includes interactive views of the components as well as a docs tab containing all the information you need to use that component. Since the screens are being treated as components, you will be able to see all of the props that the screen requires in order to be run, and how to include it.

### Quick Look

The main points of the integration notes below are:

- The main `@dgn-src-ui` can be copied in their entirety when updates are delivered
- It is **strongly** recommended UI files are not changed. If it's in the `@dgn-src-ui` folder, _you shouldn't modify it_.
- The UI is agnostic. It does not care about external logic and only has the information it needs.
- UI screens can be loaded through a `View` component.
- Forms can be interacted with after client-side submission through `react-hook-form` context methods.
- Global configuration options can be made available to the UI by sending a `config` object into the `View` component.
- DGN and MCD tech teams will need to agree on what props the UI needs to expect and the format it will be in for each screen.

### Necessary files

A lot of effort was put into organizing the project so the necessary files to use the UI are as isolated as they can be. The **only** files you should need to utilize from this repo are:

- `./package.json`
- `./jsconfig.json`
- `./public/assets/fonts`
- `./src/@dgn-src-ui`

#### package.json

This should probably _not_ be copied over wholesale (all at once). An attempt will be made to include added or updated packages in the changelog of each release. If it is not, you may have to compare your internal app file and this project's file.

#### jsconfig.json

This file tells npm an additional location to look when importing in React. The settings here allow you to import UI screens in a very similar manner to official packages like `@material-ui`.

`import BillingAddress from "@dgn-src-ui/screens/BillingAddress"`

#### fonts

The `./public` folder in react is a static folder that gets copied over to the root build of the project. Discover fonts have been placed in this folder within an `assets` folder. These will need to be copied over, but should not need to be updated once they are. We made an attempt to bundle the fonts right within the rest of the `@dgn-src-ui` code, but the Meta fonts do not get decoded correctly when loaded from anywhere else.

#### @dgn-src-ui

This folder contains all of UI components and screens. A lot of effort was put into consolidating everything into this single folder, so when a new delivery is ready, you can simply copy/paste and overwrite the existing folder.

It is our **strong** recommendation that you do not modify anything within the folder. If you do, you will either have your changes overwritten in the next delivery or you will have to continually maintain the changes between delivery.

If a change must be made, it is **strongly** advised that you contact the MCD dev team to make the change and push out a new delivery.

Ultimately, this requirement can go away once the project is complete or the MCD dev team is no longer needed for the UI screens. It only exists to aid in the integration process.
