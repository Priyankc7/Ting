# Loader Screen

The loading screen is meant to be a tranasitional screen while data for the next screen loads. The actual `Loader` screen component is a wrapper for a number of other Loaders, such as `LoadingProfile` and `ReturningToPurchase`.

## Usage

```jsx
import View from "@dgn-src-ui/core/View";

<View screen="Loader" heading="Please hold..." />;

//or

<View screen="Loader/ReturningToPurchase" />;
```

<PassingViewProps />

## Props

<Props of={Loader} />

Wrapped `Loader` screen components such as the `LoadingProfile` screen component do not require props, as they are set internally.
