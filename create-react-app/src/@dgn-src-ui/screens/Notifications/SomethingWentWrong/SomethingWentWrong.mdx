# Something Went Wrong Screen

For any number of reasons, something may go wrong with the implementation of the app and the consumer has no recourse to fix it. They may have done everything correctly, but a mistake or a timeout downstream may be preventing them from submitting correctly. This is similar to a 5XX error on a website. If there is truly no recourse for them, they should be shown this page.

## Usage

```jsx
import View from "@dgn-src-ui/core/View";

// ...

<View screen="Notifications/SomethingWentWrong" />;
```

<PassingViewProps />

## Props

<Props of={SomethingWentWrong} />
<ViewInheritance />

## Resources

- [Notification Page Component](?path=/docs/components--notification-page)
